# üëã Welcome to Your Personal Dashboard!

Hi! I'm Claude, and I'm here to help you build a customized dashboard that tracks everything you care about on the internet.

Think of this as your personal command center - a single page that shows you:
- Breaking tech news from Hacker News
- Trending GitHub repositories
- Latest research papers from arXiv
- Fashion drops from Hypebeast
- **...or whatever YOU want to track!**

## üöÄ Let's Get Started!

I'll guide you through three simple questions to customize your dashboard. After that, I'll set everything up for you automatically.

**Ready? Just say:**

```
"I'm ready to customize my dashboard!"
```

Or if you want to jump straight in:

```
"Set up my dashboard with [topics] using [theme], updating [frequency]"
```

## Step 3: Set Update Frequency

How often should your dashboard fetch fresh data?

### ‚è±Ô∏è Frequency Options

**Very Frequent (Real-time feel)**
```
Every 15 minutes - Breaking news, stock prices, live events
Every 30 minutes - Social media, active communities
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Higher server load, respect rate limits

**Regular Updates (Recommended)**
```
Every 1 hour   - General news, tech sites (RECOMMENDED)
Every 3 hours  - Blog posts, articles
Every 6 hours  - Shopping deals, releases
```
‚úÖ Good balance of freshness and efficiency

**Scheduled Updates**
```
Twice daily    - Morning (8am) and Evening (6pm)
Daily at 7am   - Overnight updates, market opens
Weekly         - Fashion drops, curated content
```
üí° Best for content that changes on a schedule

### üìÖ Smart Scheduling Tips

**Match the source:**
- Hacker News / Reddit ‚Üí Every 1-3 hours
- Research papers ‚Üí Daily
- Fashion drops ‚Üí Weekly
- Stock prices ‚Üí Every 15-30 minutes
- Blog posts ‚Üí Every 6 hours

**Consider your timezone:**
Schedule updates before you typically check the dashboard

**Avoid over-scraping:**
Be respectful of websites - don't hammer them with requests

**Just tell me:**
```
"Update every [frequency]" or "Update daily at [time]"
```

- Include error handling

### 2. Update Your Backend (1 minute)
I'll modify the Flask API to:

- Handle caching properly

### 3. Update Your Frontend (2 minutes)
I'll update the UI to:

## üÜò Need Help Deciding?

### Not Sure What to Track?

**Ask yourself:**
- What websites do I check every morning?
- What newsletters do I subscribe to?
- What do I Google regularly?
- What would save me time if it was in one place?

**Or ask me:**
```
"What should I track if I'm interested in [topic]?"
"Show me examples of dashboards for [profession/hobby]"
```

### Can't Pick a Theme?

**Ask yourself:**
- When will I use this most? (Day/night)
- What colors do I like?
- Do I want it professional or fun?

**Or just say:**
```
"Surprise me with a theme!" (I'll pick based on your content)
```

### Not Sure About Update Frequency?

**Start with:**
- **Every hour** for most sources (you can change it later)
- **Twice daily** if you only check morning/evening
- **As needed** and just use the manual refresh button

```
"I'm ready to customize my dashboard!"

(I'll do it all at once)

```
"Help me decide what to track"
```
(I'll ask about your interests and suggest sources)

```
"Show me a demo setup"
```
(I'll set up a sample dashboard so you can see how it works)
